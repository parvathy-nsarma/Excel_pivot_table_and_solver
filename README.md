# Analyzed house price data using Excel Solver using Regression. 

The coefficient of determination is also called r-squared and is denoted as r2

r2 = SSR/SST = regression sum of squares / total sum of squares           Note:  0 < r2 < 1
R2 = SSR/SST = 18934.93478/32600.5 = 0.58081731
FSTAT = MSR/MSE = 18934.93478 / 1708.196 = 11.08476
Degree of Freedom – 1,8
Pvalue of F-test = 0.010394016
Null and alternative hypotheses
	  H0:  β1 = 0	(no linear relationship)
	  H1:  β1 ≠ 0	(linear relationship does exist)
    
Decision: Reject H0 at α = 0.05

Conclusion: 58.08% of the variation in house prices is explained by variation in square feet and there is not sufficient evidence to reject that house size (square footage) does not affects house price.

At 95% level of confidence, the confidence interval for the slope is (0.0337, 0.1858)

# Technical Assignment 1

1.	The file “assignment1_actors.xls” contains information on 66 movie stars. This data set contains five variables:
a.	Gender
b.	DomesticGross: average domestic gross of star’s last few movies (in $ million)
c.	ForeignGross: average foreign gross of star’s last few movies (in $ million)
d.	Salary: current amount the star asks for a movie (in $ million)

Question 1. Using bin width of 2 (0-2, 2-4, 4-6, etc.), draw a histogram using the “salary” variable using Excel

Question 2. Is there an association between a star’s domestic and foreign gross? Choose an appropriate tool to analyze this problem. Show your work in Excel, and put some brief analysis under the chart / table / picture you have in Excel

2.	The file “Assignment1_Commute.xls” contains average time it takes for a citizen of each metropolitan area to commute to work and back home each day.

Question 3. Generate a histogram for distribution of daily commute times. Are shorter or longer commute times generally more likely for these commuters? (Hint: analyze the shape of the distribution).

3.	The file “Assignment1_Mortgage.xls” contains annual interest rates on 30-year fixed mortgages over the years. 

Question 4. What conclusions can be drawn through time series analysis generated from this data?

# Technical Assignment 2: Pivot Table

Using the data set we worked on in lab 2, answer the following questions.
1.	Flops
Worldwide, what product sold the least number of units?
2.	Top Seller
In U.S., what product category provided the most revenue in 2011?  
3.	Sales by Product Category
Worldwide, what percentage did the off-road bikes contribute to the overall bicycle sales quantity?  
In which three cities was this percentage significantly above the average?
4.	Seasonal Behavior
Bicycles and accessories are more likely to be bought in spring and summer as in fall and winter time. Find which product is an exception to this rule. You can use the worldwide data or the U.S. data, the trend is the same.
